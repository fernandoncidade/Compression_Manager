Privacy Policy of COMPRESSION MANAGER
Last updated: October 7, 2025
Version: 0.0.1.0

This Policy describes how COMPRESSION MANAGER (“Software”) handles user information. The Software is designed to operate locally, without telemetry collection.

1. Scope and Principles
- Local operation: all data processed by the Software remains on your device.
- Minimization: only information necessary to perform compression, extraction and preference maintenance is processed.
- Transparency and control: you control opening, compressing, extracting, exporting, importing and deleting files generated.

2. Data Processed by the Software
2.1 Content you handle
- Files and folders you add for compression or extraction (file names, basic metadata required for file operations).
- Preference settings (for example, target formats, compression levels, output directories).

2.2 Files you choose
- Import/Open: when you choose a file (for example .zip, .7z, .tar, .wim, .pdf, .xlsx) to extract or to read information, the Software accesses only that file(s).
- Export/Save: when creating a compressed file (.zip, .7z, .tar, .wim) or generating reports, the Software writes those files to the location you select.

2.3 Local technical data
- Local configuration and preference files (for example config.json, language.json) and, if generated, local execution or error logs may be kept for operation and diagnosis.
- There is no automatic collection of personal identifiers or sending of data to external servers by the Software.

3. What the Software DOES NOT Collect or Transmit
- No account registration or login is required by the Software.
- No built‑in telemetry, analytics or online tracking.
- No automatic sending of data to developer servers or third parties.
- No scanning of folders beyond the files you explicitly choose to open/import.

4. Storage and Retention
- Storage location: configurations and preferences are saved in JSON files in the user's persistent path (for example AppData). The exact path is determined by the operating system.
- Exports: compressed files and generated reports are written to the location you choose at the time of saving.
- Logs & records: any error logs are recorded locally, when enabled, and can be removed manually.
- Retention: data remains until you edit, clear or delete it; you can manually delete configuration files, logs and exports at any time.

5. Legal Basis (LGPD)
- Local data processing is carried out to perform the Software's functionalities at the user's request. Since data is not sent to the developer, you retain direct control over it.

6. Sharing
- The Software does not share data automatically. Any sharing occurs only by your action (e.g., sending a compressed file or report to third parties).

7. Security
- Because data remains only on your device, protection depends on your system safeguards (user accounts, permissions, antivirus, backups). It is recommended to keep the system up to date and make periodic backups.

8. Integration with 7‑Zip and Third‑Party Executables
- The Software integrates with the 7‑Zip executable (7zG.exe) for compression/extraction operations. The application looks for a 7‑Zip executable included in the application's "7-Zip" folder or in the system standard paths (Program Files). If 7‑Zip is not found, compression/extraction operations will not work and the user will be notified.
- Use of 7‑Zip is local; searching for and executing the binary occurs on your system according to local permissions.

9. Error Reporting and Diagnostics
- The Software does not send error reports to the developer. Any error logs may be recorded locally for inspection.
- If the operating system generates crash reports (e.g., Windows Error Reporting), this occurs according to your system settings and the privacy policy of the respective vendor.

10. Data Subject Rights (LGPD)
- Access, correction and deletion: you can view, edit and delete configuration files and exports directly in your file system. For complete removal, manually delete files generated by the Software (config.json, language.json, logs, exports).
- Portability: use the export functions to obtain copies of files processed.

11. Children and Minors
- The Software is not directed to children under 13 years old and does not intentionally collect personal data.

12. Third Parties and Libraries
- The Software uses third‑party libraries and tools (for example PySide6, openpyxl, PyPDF2, reportlab, 7‑Zip) only to provide local functionality (interface, file reading/writing, report generation). These libraries do not automatically send data on behalf of the Software. Licenses and notices are available in the "Notices/Licenses" section of the installer.

13. Changes to this Policy
- This Policy may be updated. In case of material changes, the date at the top will be updated and, when appropriate, an in‑app notice may be provided.
