Key features:
- The purpose of the application remains the same: a lightweight graphical utility for Windows designed for packing, extracting and integrity-checking files and folders. It supports multiple formats (ZIP, 7Z, TAR, WIM and others recognized by 7‑Zip), selection of multiple output directories, configurable compression methods, a process queue and drag-and-drop operation. The interface is multilingual (pt_BR / en_US) and prepared for packaging as an executable (distribution without the need for manual installation of Python dependencies). No new features were added, preserving the simplicity and focus of the application.

RELEASE NOTES: Version: 0.0.1.0
October 7, 2025

Summary:
Manager Compression is a lightweight graphical utility for Windows designed for packing, extracting and integrity-checking files and folders. It supports multiple formats (ZIP, 7Z, TAR, WIM and others recognized by 7‑Zip), multiple output directories per format, configurable compression methods, a process queue, and drag-and-drop operation. The interface is multilingual (pt_BR / en_US) and prepared for packaging as a standalone executable (no manual Python dependency installation required for end users).

Key features:
- Compress folders and files into .zip, .7z, .tar and .wim formats.
- Extract compressed archives in many formats supported by 7‑Zip (.rar, .zip, .7z, .tar, .wim, .bz2, .tar.xz, .tgz, .tar.gz, .zipx, .lzh, .iso, etc.).
- Select and persist multiple output directories, independently per format.
- Drag & drop support to add files and folders to input and output lists.
- Configurable compression methods per format (levels 0–9 where applicable) with preference persistence.
- "Save As" mode to create packages with specific settings without changing default preferences.
- Option to update existing archives instead of recreating them.
- Archive integrity testing using 7‑Zip's "t" command to validate packages.
- Compression queueing: new jobs can wait while another task of the same format runs.
- Translatable messages and dialogs; runtime language switching.
- "About" dialog displays description, history, licenses, notices and privacy policy loaded from included resources.
- Offline operation: all data is stored locally (configuration and preference files saved in the user's persistent directory).
