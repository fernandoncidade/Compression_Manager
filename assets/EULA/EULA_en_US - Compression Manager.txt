END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT - COMPRESSION MANAGER
Version 0.0.3.0, November 18, 2025

Copyright (c) 2025 Fernando Nillsson Cidade. All rights reserved.

By installing, copying or using the Software distributed as an executable, you agree to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not agree to the terms of this License, do not install or use the Software.

1. DEFINITIONS
   "Licensor": Fernando Nillsson Cidade, the copyright holder of the Software.
   "Software": COMPRESSION MANAGER — a graphical utility for packaging, extracting and integrity verification of files and folders, including the installed executable, its embedded resources and associated documentation.
   "Licensee" or "You": the natural person or legal entity that installs or uses the Software.

2. DISTRIBUTION ENVIRONMENT
   The Software is distributed as an installer/executable for Windows. The end user does not need to install Python or additional libraries to run the Software; dependencies are packaged in the executable as listed in requirements.txt.

3. GRANT OF LICENSE
   Subject to the terms of this License, the Licensor grants the Licensee a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to use the Software according to the acquired modality (free or commercial).

4. USE RESTRICTIONS
   The Licensee shall not:
   a) Reproduce, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, lend, sell or transfer the executable, except when authorized by a separate commercial agreement;
   b) Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or attempt to extract source code from the executable, except as expressly permitted by applicable law;
   c) Remove or alter intellectual property or trademark notices present in the Software;
   d) Use the Software for illegal purposes or in violation of applicable regulations.

5. FEATURES AND DATA
   - The Software stores settings and operational data locally (for example, config.json, language.json, tasks/filestates, exports) in the user's persistent path (for example, AppData). The standard executable does not automatically transmit data to external servers.
   - The Software supports export (for example, .zip, .7z, .tar, .wim, reports in PDF/XLSX) and import according to features included in the build. Exported files are saved to the location chosen by the user.
   - Compression/extraction operations depend on the 7‑Zip binary (7zG.exe) present on the system or included in the application's "7-Zip" folder; if missing, such operations will not function and the user will be notified.

6. THIRD PARTIES
   - The Software incorporates third-party components (for example, PySide6, shiboken6, PyInstaller, pywin32 and other dependencies listed in requirements.txt) subject to their own licenses. License texts and the list of third-party components accompany the installer (see NOTICE_pt_BR.txt and LICENSES in the distribution package).
   - Use of these components is subject to their respective licenses; it is the responsibility of the binary redistributor to include any required license information (for example, requirements for 7‑Zip).

7. UPDATES AND SUPPORT
   The Licensor may, at its sole discretion, provide updates or fixes. Technical support and update terms depend on the license modality acquired (see the Commercial Agreement when applicable).

8. LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIABILITY
   - The Software is provided "AS IS", without express or implied warranties, except as required by applicable law.
   - To the extent permitted by law, the Licensor shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential damages or loss of profits arising out of or in connection with the use or inability to use the Software.
   - Where direct liability is admitted by law, compensation shall be limited to the amount paid for the Software (if applicable) or R$ 5.00, whichever is greater.

9. PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION
   - Data generated by use of the Software (for example, settings, optional logs, exports) remain under the user's control and are stored locally.
   - The Licensor declares that the standard executable does not collect telemetry automatically. Processing of any personal data will follow the Privacy Policy included in the package (assets/PRIVACY_POLICY/Privacy_Policy_pt_BR.txt).

10. TERMINATION
    This License may be terminated for breach of its terms. Upon termination, the Licensee must cease use and remove the executable as applicable.

11. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION
    This License shall be governed by Brazilian law. For dispute resolution, the courts of the District of São José dos Pinhais, State of Paraná, Brazil, are hereby elected.

12. ACCESSIBILITY STATEMENT
    Documentation and accessibility-related files (when included in the distribution) are provided with the installer; their presence does not alter the liability limitations of this License.

13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
    This License, together with the Privacy Policy and third-party license documents included in the installer, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Software.
